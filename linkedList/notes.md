<!-- Understanding Linked Lists: -->

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for dynamic memory management and efficient insertions and deletions.

<!-- Types of Linked Lists: -->

Singly Linked List: Each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Example: Example: A train with carriages connected in a single direction.

Doubly Linked List: Each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal.
Example: Web browser's history feature.

Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
Example: Playlist loop in a music player.
